		<p>As of now I have done an internship at the Department of Revenue in Raleigh, NC. My job title
		was IT Security Intern and some of the job task were to create, modify, and configure controls for Resource Security Plans(RSP) for
		the department lasting for 10 weeks.

			<span class="image left" ><img src="breakfast_example.png" alt=""/></span><t/> In my Software Engineer class my and I
			created an application where users can make a order and have it sent in to kitchen. The main objectives of this app was
			to have efficent order transactions and ease the day to day work flow. All the orders will be stored in a database easily viewable 
			for the chef or manager if needed. Me and group created a profile for the project. <a href="https://cool-coders-ecsu.github.io/FoodDude/"><b>Check it out</b></a>
		
			I am interested in doing more exciting projects, internships, or full time work if you have any suggestions or ideas please
		get in contact with me I'll be glad to hear from you!
